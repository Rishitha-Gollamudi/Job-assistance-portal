        "pros": "Most mission-driven company I have worked for. Zoox has a clear vision for autonomous mobility-as-a-service, and we are truly all in this together. Nicest engineers I have ever worked with. People here are truly brilliant and want the company to succeed.",
        "cons": "It's a lot of hard work, and it's a long term play. The compensation is structured in a way that people who stay will be (potentially massively) rewarded, and this is not a \"get in and get rich quick\" company. For the record, I think the compensation structure attracts people who are in it for the long haul, which is an overall advantage. What Zoox is doing is too complicated to rely on a new class of engineers cycling in and out every 2 years. You do need to remind yourself of the big picture at times. That being said, the opportunities I have had at Zoox have far exceeded anything I could have imagined when I started."
